Calibration and Simulation Engine for Local Volatility Models
-------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains calibration and simulation routines for deterministic/stochastic local volatility models with deterministic/stochastic interest rates, implemented in Python.

The manuscript that gives the details of the calibration algorithms can be accessed at https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14764. This repository provides a sample implementation of these algorithms.
